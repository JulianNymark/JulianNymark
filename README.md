### Hi there 👋

This text is a test of your patience!

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** ... it changes all the time, and keeping this list up to date is a pipe dream (did you know that the idiom `pipe dream` originates from those that smoked opioids with pipes in the 1800s?)
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** ... _more_ frontend stuff, serverless/edge, but also neural networks (LLM's), also hardware... rp2040 based things, esp32 things, rpi 4 things, home assistant, setting up some weird self-hosted & open-source voice assistant thing (mycroft)... and tomorrow it'll all be gone! (unless it ends up sticking)
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on** ... I have no clue! (but I do love collaborating!). Mostly I want to do something that ends up mattering (to others and myself), and that helps others do what they want.
- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with** ... finding the things that matter (more than other things that I already know matter, I'm full of biases, and sometimes A _thing_ comes along and you didn't even realise it was the _most important thing ever_ until you discovered it!). If you find one of these things, do tell!
- 💬 **Ask me about** ... my weird opinions on stuff? I probably have at least _one_ opinion on XYZ (and if I I don't i'll have to make one up!)
- 📫 **How to reach me:** find my contact info somewhere on juliannymark.com, it's a treasure hunt!
- ⚡ **Fun fact (not about me):** you can make a section like this one on your github profile by making a repository named after your account.
- ❓ **Bonus fun fact (this time it's about me):** ... I like to try and deep dive into peoples custom websites, and then try to learn a fair bit about how they speak, how they think, and try to absorb the best bits for myself! Actually... this just describes "browsing the web" so scratch that... I'll come up with a better fun fact...

## things to avoid

- the [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem)
- trusting semver major versions to be backwards compatible! (humans created that version bump). What do we do then!? we see if it works! (aka. testing)
- assumptions in general (kind of a repetition of the XY problem)
- repetition (unless... it's the _good_ kind of repetition)
